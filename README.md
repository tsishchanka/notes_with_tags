### [App](https://6239c4ce79c92d66a5dab574--fluffy-alfajores-71ec77.netlify.app/) on netlify
The application was created as a test task, it was proposed to use a JSON server to store data.
JSON is not implemented, data manipulation is carried out using React and Redux
    

    The backend of the application will soon be developed using Node.js (not within the scope of the task).
