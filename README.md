### [App](https://623ac10dd91fae0009535edb--fluffy-alfajores-71ec77.netlify.app/notes-list) on netlify
The application was created as a test task, it was proposed to use a JSON server to store data.
JSON is not implemented, data manipulation is carried out using React and Redux    

* When implemented with JSON, I would not meet the deadline.
* Since I am currently studying Node.js, backend of the application will soon be developed using Node.js (but not within the scope of the task)
